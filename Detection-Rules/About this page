## Overview

This repository contains detection rules designed for Security Operations Centers (SOCs), written in Kusto Query Language (KQL). 
Each detection rule is structured around a Use Case (UC), which is directly mapped to a relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique.

By organizing detection rules this way, we ensure clear alignment with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, making it easier for SOC analysts to 
implement and customize the rules according to their specific needs.

## Detection Rule Structure

Each detection rule follows a standard format that includes the following information:
- Use Case (UC): Each rule is associated with a specific Use Case (UC) that represents a MITRE ATT&CK Tactic
- KQL Query: The detection rule is written in Kusto Query Language (KQL) and is ready to be used in environments such as Microsoft Sentinel
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: Each rule is tagged with the MITRE ATT&CK Technique number to show which part of the framework it addresses.
